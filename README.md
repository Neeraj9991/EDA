# Conclusion and Advice for a New Startup Owner and Investor:
 
NOTE: The analysis of Indian startup funding data is based on time period 2015 to 2020.

We can draw several conclusions and provide advice for both new startup owners and investors.

1. It is important to note that there are missing values in several columns, including remarks, amount_usd, sub_vertical, city_location, and industry_vertical. Therefore, it is crucial to address and handle missing data appropriately before drawing any definitive conclusions.

2. Funding Amounts:
The highest funded startup in the dataset is "Rapido Bike Taxi" with funding of 32,186.7 crores. On average, Indian startups received funding of 151 crores. However, it is essential to consider that these numbers are specific to the dataset analyzed, and funding amounts may vary widely in reality.

3. Number of Funded Startups:
A total of 2,457 Indian startups were funded from 2015 to 2020. Notably, "Ola Cabs" and "Swiggy" received the maximum number of fundings (8 each), indicating their popularity and investor confidence in these ventures.

4. Funding by Sector:
The Consumer Internet sector received the maximum number of fundings (941), followed by Technology and eCommerce. However, in terms of funding amount, eCommerce was the highest, followed by Consumer Internet and Transportation.

5. Subcategories:
Within the sectors, specific subcategories received significant funding. Notably, "Online Lending Platform" attracted the highest number of fundings, followed by "Online Pharmacy" and "Food Delivery Platform." New startups in these subcategories may find a favorable investment climate.

6. Preferred Cities:
Investors showed a preference for cities like Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Gurgaon. These cities have established ecosystems, infrastructure, and access to resources that make them attractive to startups and investors alike.

7. Prominent Investors:
Ratan Tata and Indian Angel Network emerged as key investors, contributing to the maximum number of startups. Their involvement indicates a strong endorsement and support for the startups they have funded.

8. Undisclosed Funding:
It is worth noting that a significant number of funding rounds remain undisclosed to the public. This suggests that there may be additional funding opportunities beyond the dataset's scope, making it crucial for startups to explore various avenues and investor networks.

9. Funding Trends:
The number of funding rounds decreased over the years, with the highest number in 2016 (993) and a significant drop in 2020 (7). While the decrease in the number of fundings may be a concern, the funding amounts remained relatively stable, except for the sharp drop in 2020. This could be attributed to various factors such as insufficient data or the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

10. Investment Types:
The top three investment types were Seed/Angel Funding (52.6%), Private Equity (46.5%), and Debt Funding (0.9%). Startup owners and investors should be aware of these investment types and explore suitable options based on their specific requirements and risk tolerance.
